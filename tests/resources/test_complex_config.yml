# :Parameters:
#
# - aligner: either star, bowtie or bowtie2. 
# - genome_directory: directory where all indexes are written.
# - rRNA_contaminant: path to an existing fasta file for ribosomal RNA (to be found in
#   genome_directory)
# - rRNA_feature: if rRNA_contaminant is not provided, ribosomal RNA will be extract
#     from GFF using this feature name. It must be found.

# Quality trimming and adapter removal
#
# for cutadapt, please fill the fwd and rev fields if required. It can be a
# string, or a filename. If a filename, it must be prefixed with "file:" to
# specify that it is a file and not a string. If the tool is cutadapt, the empty
# fwd and rev fields means that no adapters are to be used.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - fwd: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - m: 20 means discard trimmed reads that are shorter than 20.
#         must be > 0
# - quality: 0 means no trimming, 30 means keep base with quality
#        above 30
# - mode: must be set to one of
#     - g for 5'
#     - a for 3'
#     - b for both 5'/3'
# - rev: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - tool: only cutadapt supported for now
# - threads: number of threads to use (atropos only)
# - options: See cutadapt documentation for details on
#            cutadapt.readthedocs.io. We change the default value
#            of -O to 6 (at least 6 bases are required to match before
#            trimming of an adapter)
#
# tool_choice__ = ["atropos", "cutadapt", "fastp"]
#
# trim-n trims Ns at the end of the read
